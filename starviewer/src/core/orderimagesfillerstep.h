/**
 * @brief The OrderImagesFillerStep class orders images inside each volume.
 *
 * To achieve this it decides the order and then calls setOrderNumberInVolume() for each image and setImages() for each series (so that the series has the list
 * of images in the correct order).
 *
 * Images that can be spatially sorted are separated by acquisition number and stack id, then sorted by Image::distance inside each group; then stacks inside
 * each acquisition are sorted by minimum Image::distance and finally acquisitions are also sorted by minimum Image::distance. Images with the same position are
 * sorted with the same criteria as images that can't be spatially sorted, according to a set of more or less abstract values; these are, in order of
 * preference, dimension index values, instance number SOP instance UID, and frame number.
 *
 * For more information read qms://doc/065875b1.
